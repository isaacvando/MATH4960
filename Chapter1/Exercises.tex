  \subsection*{Section 1}
  \exercise{1.1.i} 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] Let $f : x \ra y$ be a morphism and $g, g' : y \ra x$ be inverses. Then $fg = \id_y$ and $gf = \id_x$ (resp $g'$). Hence $gf = g'f$ so 
    \begin{align*} 
      gfg &= g'fg \\
      g &= g'
    \end{align*}
  Therefore any morphism has at most one inverse. ///

  \item[(ii)] Suppose there are morphisms $g,h : y \rightrightarrows x$ such that $fg = \id_y$ and $hf = \id_x$. Then
    \begin{align*}
      hfg &= h \\
      g &= h
    \end{align*}
  Hence $fg = \id_y$ and $gf = \id_x$ so $f$ is an isomorphism. ///
  \end{itemize}

  \exercise{1.1.ii}
  Consider a category $C$ and the subset of isomorphisms it contains. The subset contains the identity morphisms for each object because the identity is an isomorphism. The subset inherits associativity from $C$. Now pick two isomorphisms $f : x \ra y$ and $g : y \ra z$ and consider $gf$. We have $(f^{-1}g^{-1})gf = f^{-1}g^{-1}gf = f^{-1}f = \id_x$ and $gf(f^{-1}g^{-1}) = \id_y$ so $gf$ is also an isomorphism. Hence $C$ contains a maximal groupoid. ///
  

  \exercise{1.1.iii}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] Observe that for any object $f : c \ra x$ in $c/C$, the morphism $\id_x : x \ra x$ is the identity morphism for $f$. Now pick two morphisms in $c/C$, $h : x \ra y$ and $k : y \ra z$ and consider $kh$.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      & c \arrow[ld, "f"'] \arrow[d, "g" description] \arrow[rd, "b"] &   \\
      x \arrow[r, "h"] & y \arrow[r, "k"] & z
    \end{tikzcd}
  \end{center}

  Because $hf = g$ and $kg = b$ we have $khf = b$ so $kh$ is a morphism in $c/C$ which is enough to show it is a category. ///

    \item[(ii)] A similar argument as above shows that $C/c$ is a category. ///
  \end{itemize}


  \subsection*{Section 2}
  % \exercise{1.2.ii}
  % \begin{itemize}
  %   \item[(i)] $(\implies)$ Suppose $f : x \ra y$ is a split epimorphism. Now pick a morphism $h$ in $C(c,y)$. We may write 
  % \end{itemize}


  \exercise{1.2.iii}
  Let $f : x \hookrightarrow y$ and $g : y \hookrightarrow z$ be monomorphisms and $h,k : w \ra x$ be morphisms such that $gfh = gfk$. Because $g$ is monic, it follows that $fh = fk$. Similarly, because $f$ is monic we have $h = k$. Hence $gf$ is monic. 

  Now suppose $f$ and $g$ are simply morphisms and that $gf$ is monic. BWOC suppose that $f$ is not monic. Then there exist morphisms $h,k$ such that $fh = fk$ but $h \ne k$. Hence we have $gfh = gfk$ this is a contradiction because $gf$ being monic implies that $h = k$. Hence $f$ is monic. 

  Now observe that the monomorphisms in a category form a subcategory. Every object has an identity morphism because the identity is monic. Associativity is inherited from the larger category and composition is preserved because the composition of two monomorphisms is also a monomorphisms as shown above.

  By duality the epimorphisms also form a subcategory. ///

  \exercise{1.2.iv} Q: What are the monomorphisms in \cat{Field}. Haven't been able to crack this one yet. 

  \exercise{1.2.v} In \cat{Ring}, consider the inclusion map $i : \Z \hookrightarrow \Q$. Now pick two morphisms, $f,g : R \rightrightarrows \Z$ such that $if = ig$ where $R$ is some ring. Now BWOC suppose that $f \ne g$. Then there exists an $r \in R$ such that $f(r) \ne g(r)$. Hence $i(f(r)) \ne i(g(r))$ so $if \ne ig$ which is a contradiction. Hence the above implies that $f = g$ so $i$ is monic. 

  Now pick morphisms $h,k : \Q \rightrightarrows R$ such that $hi = ki$. This means that for all integers $z$, $h(z) = k(z)$. Each rational $q$ may be written canonically as $nd^{-1}$ for $n, d \in \Z$. Hence $h(q) = h(nd^{-1}) = h(n)h(d^{-1})$. Further, because every element in $\Q$ is a unit, $h(n)h(d^{-1}) = h(n)h(d)^{-1}$. Because $h$ and $k$ agree on the integers, we have $h(n)h(d)^{-1} = k(n)k(d)^{-1}$. Hence $h = k$ and $i$ is an epimorphism. 

  $\Q$ and $\Z$ are not isomorphic in \cat{Ring} because $\Q$ is a field while $\Z$ is not. Hence in \cat{Ring}, monic and epic does not imply isomorphism. /// 

  \exercise{1.2.vii} For a given subset of objects $A \subseteq P$, consider $M_A = \{ x \in \mathrm{obj}P | \forall a \in A, \exists f \in P(a,x) \}$, i.e. the set of all elements in $P$ targeted by a morphism from every element in $A$. If it exists (when could it not exist?), the supremum of $A$ is the least element in $M_A$ w.r.t. $\le$. 

  By duality...



  \subsection*{Section 3}
  \exercise{1.3.i} Given two groups $G$ and $H$, a functor $\mathrm{B}G \ra \mathrm{B}H$ is a group homomorphism. Given such a functor $F$, and elements $x,y \in G$, that is morphisms in $\mathrm{B}G$, we have $F(x)F(y) = F(xy)$ which is exactly a group homomorphism. ///
  
  % Given two groups $G$ and $H$, a functor $\mathrm{B}G \ra \mathrm{B}H$ takes the object in $\mathrm{B}G$ to the object in $\mathrm{B}H$, the identity morphism to the identity morphism, and each other morphism in $\mathrm{B}G$ to a morhpism in $\mathrm{B}H$. (What is this question asking?)


  \exercise{1.3.iv} First observe that $C(c,-)$ and $C(-,c)$ both preserve identities. Consider the action of $C(c,-)$ on $\id_x : x \ra x$. $\id_x$ maps to post composition by the identity on $C(c,x)$ which is the identity morphism for $C(c,x)$. Similar reason applies for $C(-,c)$. 

  Now pick two morphisms $f:x \ra y$ and $g:y \ra z$ in $C$. Then $C(c,-)g \cdot C(c,-)f = g_*f_* = (gf)_* = C(c,-)(gf)$. Hence $C(c,-)$ is in fact a functor. A similar argument shows the same holds for $C(-,c)$. 

  \hl{Is this by duality?} ///

  \exercise{1.3.viii} Consider the trivial Functor $\mathbf{0} : \mathrm{Set} \ra \mathrm{Set}$ that maps every set to $\emptyset$ and every morphism to $\id_\emptyset$. Observe that this is indeed a functor because $\mathbf{0}(\id_x) = \id_{\mathbf 0 x} = \id_\emptyset$ and $\mathbf 0 (gf) = \mathbf 0 (g) \mathbf 0 (f) = \id_\emptyset$. Now pick any morphism in Set that is not an isomorphism. It is mapped to $\id_\emptyset$ which is an isomorphism. Hence functors do not reflect isomorphisms. ///

  \exercise{1.3.vi} Consider the map $\mathrm{dom} : F \commaArrow G \ra D$ that takes an object $(d,e,f) \mapsto d$ and a morphism $(h,k) \mapsto h$. Now pick an identity morphism $(\id_d, \id_e)$; clearly this functor preserves identity. Now pick a composable pair of morphisms $(h,k)$ and $(h',k')$. We have $\mathrm{dom} ((h',k')(h,k))= \mathrm{dom}(h'h,k'k) = h'h = \mathrm{dom}(h',k')\mathrm{dom}(h,k)$. Hence $\mathrm{dom}$ is a functor. Define $\mathrm{cod}$ analagously. /// (Is this right?)


  \exercise{1.3.x} Consider the mapping $\mathrm{Conj} : \mathrm{Group} \ra \mathrm{Set}$ that takes a group to the set of its conjugacy classes and a homomorphism to mapping between the
  \begin{align*}
    \mathrm{Conj} : \mathrm{Group} &\longrightarrow \mathrm{Set} \\
    G &\longmapsto \text{Conj}(G) \\
    (f : G \ra H) &\longmapsto (f': \mathrm{Conj}(G) \ra \mathrm{Conj}(H))
  \end{align*}
  Where $f'$ maps a conjugacy class containing an element $x$ to the class in $H$ containing $f(x)$ (need to show this is well defined)
